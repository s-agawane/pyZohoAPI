# Ways To Contribute

These guidelines (not rules, per se; use your best judgment) were loosely
adapted from those for [Atom](https://github.com/atom). And these guidelines,
like the source code itself, is open to suggestions and pull requests.

We want to make contributing easy and fulfilling, and will endeavor to answer
any questions you may have quickly. However, it may take a day to respond to
queries; please be patient.

This document is intended to give you an overview of the infrastructure of the
project. There is a separate document about the [coding process](coding.md)
itself.

We gladly accept contributions in any (constructive) form, including bug
reports, bug fixes, enhancements, and testing and documentation updates.

## Reporting Bugs
