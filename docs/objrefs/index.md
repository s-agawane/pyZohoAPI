# Object Reference

Objects the Zoho APIs exposes are mirrored in Python objects. These tend to be
named as a singular version of the (normally) plural name in the Zoho API
documentation.

All share the methods and properties documented in [Zoho
Objects](/userguide/zohoobject.md). Some have additional methods to implement
features and functions of the Zoho API. These additional methods are documented
under "Type-Specific Methods," below.

```{note}
This package is BETA software. Not all objects are represented, and those which
are may not implement all Zoho API function.
